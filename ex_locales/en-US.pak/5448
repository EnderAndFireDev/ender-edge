<Four files generated by Intel Wi-Fi firmware: csr.lst, fh_regs.lst, radio_reg.lst, monitor.lst.sysmon.  The first three are binary files containing register dumps, and are asserted by Intel to contain no personal or device-identifying information.  The last file is an execution trace from the Intel firmware; it has been scrubbed of any personal or device-identifying information, but is too large to display here.  These files were generated in response to recent Wi-Fi problems with your device, and will be shared with Intel to help troubleshoot these problems.>
