To better diagnose Bluetooth issues, Googlers can include additional Bluetooth logs with their feedback reports. When this option is checked, your report will include btsnoop and HCI logs from your current session, sanitized to remove as much PII as possible. Access to these logs will be restricted to managers of the Edge OS product group in Listnr. Logs will be purged after 90 days.
