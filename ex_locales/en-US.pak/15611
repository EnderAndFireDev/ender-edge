The identity of the server you are connected to cannot be fully validated. You are connected to a server using a name only valid within your network, which an external certificate authority has no way to validate ownership of. As some certificate authorities will issue certificates for these names regardless, there is no way to ensure you are connected to the intended website and not an attacker.
