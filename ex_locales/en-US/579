To set which websites $1 can view, you can configure restrictions and settings by visiting <a target="_blank" href="$3">$4</a>. If you do not change the default settings, $1 can browse everything on the web.

To prevent $1 from accessing your account, make sure you lock your profile when you're not using Ender Edge. To do this, click your profile name in the upper-right corner of the browser, and select "Exit and childlock."
